Pandemic_Bio_Terrorist
======================
HI,
So the main file is pandemic.html, which calls on all of the other files in the folder.

Still need to add the images to this repository.

Right now, the only functionality is that the pawn will move to the city that has been clicked.
Also, the "Captured!" and "Sighted!" buttons toggle the interior flags,
which will be used to determine which actions are available each turn. 

Basic functionality should be that the two/three moves per turn are displayed either above or below the game board, 
as they are chosen. In order to chose the actions, it should be triggered by clicking on the city,
or the two buttons on the right. Depending on the city clicked and the city the bio terrorist is in,
determines the action. 

Eventually, I would like to add functionality to support the user entering the cards which they drew, and possibly displaying them.
From there, the infect remotely, direct flight, charter flight, sabatoge, and escape actions could be impacted. 

Thanks,
Tori
